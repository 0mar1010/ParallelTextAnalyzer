# The Variance and the Difference Between Programming Languages, Makeable Languages, and Others Like Them

## 1. Introduction

The world of computer science is vast, and one of its most fundamental aspects is the distinction between different types of languages used to communicate with computers. These languages fall into various categories, including **programming languages**, **makeable languages**, and others that might be classified in unique ways. Understanding the differences and variances among these types of languages is essential for professionals in the field. This report aims to explore the distinctions between programming languages, makeable languages, and similar concepts, focusing on their characteristics, use cases, and underlying principles.

## 2. What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a formal language used by computer programmers to create software, scripts, or applications. These languages allow humans to communicate with computers through instructions, algorithms, and data manipulations. Programming languages are designed to express computational processes in a way that a machine can execute, typically by translating human-readable code into machine code via a compiler or interpreter.

### a. Key Characteristics of Programming Languages:
- **Syntax:** Defines the structure and rules of writing statements.
- **Semantics:** Describes the meaning of expressions and statements.
- **Typing System:** Programming languages often have systems that classify variables and operations according to their data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
- **Paradigms:** Programming languages are typically designed to support certain programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, functional, or logic-based programming.
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** Most modern programming languages come with extensive libraries or frameworks that enable developers to write applications efficiently.

### b. Examples of Programming Languages:
- **C/C++:** Low-level and high-performance programming languages used in system programming.
- **Java:** An object-oriented language designed to be platform-independent via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Python:** A high-level, easy-to-read language known for rapid development.
- **JavaScript:** A widely used language for web development that runs in browsers.
- **Haskell:** A functional programming language that emphasizes purity and immutability.

### c. Usage of Programming Languages:
- **Software Development:** Programming languages are used to write everything from simple scripts to complex software systems.
- **Web Development:** Languages like JavaScript and Python enable the creation of websites and web applications.
- **Data Science:** Languages such as R and Python are extensively used for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical operations.
- **Embedded Systems:** Low-level languages like C and assembly are used to program embedded systems and hardware interfaces.

## 3. What is a Makeable Language?

A **makeable language** refers to a language that is constructed or "made" for specific tasks or use cases, usually involving design tools or frameworks. These languages may not necessarily be general-purpose programming languages, but are often created to serve specialized tasks such as managing databases, querying systems, or configuring complex workflows. Makeable languages can be considered as **domain-specific languages (DSLs)** that are designed to work efficiently within specific domains or applications.

### a. Key Characteristics of Makeable Languages:
- **Domain-Specific:** Designed for specific problem domains rather than general-purpose computing.
- **Simplified Syntax:** Often have simpler syntax compared to general programming languages, making them more accessible to domain experts who are not skilled programmers.
- **Limited Scope:** Makeable languages are not intended to replace general-purpose programming languages but are used to solve particular problems more efficiently.
- **Built-in Functionality:** They often come with built-in functions or constructs tailored to specific applications or industries.

### b. Examples of Makeable Languages:
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A language specifically designed for managing and querying relational databases.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for describing the structure and style of web pages, respectively.
- **VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language):** A language used to describe the behavior and structure of digital electronic systems, especially for FPGA and ASIC designs.
- **LaTeX:** A typesetting system used for creating documents that require complex formatting, especially in academic and scientific communities.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that provides an efficient, flexible way to request data.

### c. Usage of Makeable Languages:
- **Database Management:** SQL is widely used to interact with relational databases.
- **Web Design and Development:** HTML and CSS are fundamental to web page creation.
- **Digital Circuit Design:** VHDL is used to describe hardware circuits.
- **Document Formatting:** LaTeX is used to write academic papers, especially those involving mathematical equations.

## 4. Other Types of Languages and Their Differences

In addition to programming languages and makeable languages, several other types of languages are used in computing, each with its own purpose and scope. These may include **scripting languages**, **markup languages**, **query languages**, and **configuration languages**. 

### a. Scripting Languages:
- **Definition:** Scripting languages are typically used to automate tasks, process data, or manipulate files. They are often interpreted rather than compiled and are generally more flexible than traditional programming languages.
- **Examples:** Python, Ruby, Perl, and Bash are all popular scripting languages used for automation, web scraping, system administration, and more.

### b. Markup Languages:
- **Definition:** Markup languages are designed to annotate or structure text, typically to control how content is displayed or formatted. These languages are not used for programming computations but for describing the structure or appearance of documents.
- **Examples:** HTML, XML, and Markdown are widely used to structure web pages, data files, and documents.

### c. Query Languages:
- **Definition:** Query languages are used to retrieve and manipulate data from databases or information systems. These languages allow users to interact with and extract specific data from large datasets.
- **Examples:** SQL (for relational databases) and SPARQL (for querying RDF datasets) are popular query languages used in data management.

### d. Configuration Languages:
- **Definition:** These languages are used to specify the configuration settings of software applications or systems. They allow users to define and modify system behaviors without altering the core codebase.
- **Examples:** YAML, JSON, and TOML are common configuration languages used in system configuration files and deployment settings.

## 5. Key Differences Between Programming Languages and Makeable Languages

While **programming languages** and **makeable languages** are both used to instruct computers, they differ in their design and usage:

- **Scope:**
  - **Programming Languages** are designed to be versatile, enabling users to write complex applications across various domains.
  - **Makeable Languages** are designed for specific tasks or domains and are optimized for simplicity in those contexts.

- **Complexity:**
  - **Programming Languages** generally offer more power and complexity, allowing users to express intricate logic, algorithms, and behaviors.
  - **Makeable Languages** tend to be more focused on domain-specific constructs, offering a simplified syntax for those familiar with the domain but less flexibility in general computing tasks.

- **Purpose:**
  - **Programming Languages** are intended for building applications, systems, and software across all domains.
  - **Makeable Languages** are generally tailored to automate or simplify specific tasks, such as data querying, formatting, or system configuration.

## 6. Conclusion

In summary, **programming languages** are essential for general-purpose computing and allow developers to create software and applications across various fields. **Makeable languages**, on the other hand, are domain-specific and created to solve specific problems efficiently within a narrower scope. The primary difference between them lies in their generality and complexity: programming languages are versatile and feature-rich, while makeable languages are simple and specialized. Understanding the distinctions and applications of each is crucial for choosing the right language for a given task, whether it be for software development, data manipulation, or system configuration.
